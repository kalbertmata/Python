1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

print "hello world") # we get a syntaxError Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
print "hello world" # we get a syntaxError Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks,

or both?

#print("hello world) # we get a syntaxError) # SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
#print(hello world) # we get a syntaxError) # SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus

sign before a number? What about 2++2?

number = +2
print(number) # It prints the number
number= 2++2
print(number) # Adds the two numbers in this case 4

4. In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?

number = 02
print(number) # SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted;

5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

number = 2 2
print(number) #SyntaxError: invalid syntax
