1.Weâ€™ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?

42 = n SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal

2.How about x = y = 1?

x=y=1  1 will be assinged to x and y so if we do print(x+y) the result will be 2

3.In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?

number = 32;
print(number); It seems to work with or without the semi-colon

4.In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?

x=y=1

print(xy) It throws an NameError: name 'xy' is not defined
