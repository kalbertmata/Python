#Exercise 1: basic math (2 points)

#Use the Python print function as a basic calculator using math expressions. Provide three different statements using three different math symbols.

print(3-2)
print(4*8)
print(2**2)

#Exercise 2: three values (2 points)

#Use the print function with three different values in one statement, such as "oranges", "apples", "bananas"

print("this is")
print("a fun")
print("Python class")

#Exercise 3: my name (2 points)

#Create two variables called first_name and last_name. Assign these two variables to your name accordingly.
#Using the print function in Python, make it print the following statement in one line:

first_name= "Kalbert"
last_name="Mata"
print("This is my name"+" "+first_name+" "+last_name)

#Exercise 4: variables multiplication (2 points)

#Create two variables and assign them a number. Next, multiply the variables together using the math expression
#and store the results in a third variable.Use print to reveal the results from the third variable.

x= 10
y= 100
z=x*y
print(z)

#Exercise 5: hours-minutes (2 points)

#Create two variables to hold values for a pay rate and minutes worked.

pay_rate= 18
minutes_worked= 470

#Create another variable to convert the amount of minutes to hours.

hours_worked= minutes_worked / 60

#Create a results variable to calculate the hours and the pay rate.

results = hours_worked * pay_rate

#Assign pay rate = 18 and minutes = 470.

#Using the print function, display the pay results with a dollar sign in front of the value. (eg, $126)

print("$"+str(results))
